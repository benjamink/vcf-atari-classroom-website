    <h1>Welcome to the VCF Atari Classroom!</h1>

    <p>You've stumbled across a very special website that has been designed & build <b><em>exclusively</em></b> for the Atari Classroom here at <a href="https://vcfed.org/events/vintage-computer-festival-east/" target="_blank">VCF East</a>!</p>

    <p>Hopefully you're here in person & you've been fortunate enough to secure yourself a seat in front of a real live working Atari 800XL computer where you can learn to build your very own exciting new programs, games & utilities!  If you weren't able to get your name in fast enough to have one of these elusive seats have no fear, we have something special for you too!</p>

    <h2>Introducing the FujiNet Virtual Machine</h2>

    <p>The FujiNet Virtual Machine is a pre-built Linux desktop with everything you need to get started actually <b><em>use FujiNet</em></b> without needing <em>any</em> hardware other than a reasonably modern computer to run on.</p>

    <p>We wanted to provide a way for VCF East attendees to be able to download this rather large (~3.5GB) file without having to worry about a slow Internet connection or using up your valuable cell data allowances.  Since you've arrived at this web site you're already on the VCF East local network connection already so downloading the VM file should be relatively painless.</p>

    <p>So what do you actually need to run use this VM?  It's very simple.  The easiest option is to use either <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Oracle VirtualBox</a> or <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html" target="_blank">VMware Workstation Player</a>.  Both of these tools are able to import & run the virtual appliance (OVA) version.  However, if you prefer to run something less encumbered by commercial ownership you might prefer something like <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> which can run the QCow2 version.  Keep reading below to learn how to download the version that makes the most sense for you.</p>

    <h2>System Requirements</h2>

    <p>Each version of the VM requires <em>at least</em> <b>1 CPU & 4GB of RAM</b> for the guest system itself.  Providing the VM with more CPU & especially more RAM will help dramatically improve performance.  2 CPUs & 8GB of RAM is recommended if possible.  In addition to the CPU/memory resources you'll need at least 20GB of free hard disk space for the VM's disk itself.</p>
